## 1. Architecture Overview
<!-- High-level system description. Include an ASCII or Mermaid component diagram. -->

## 2. Technology Choices
| Component | Choice | Why | Alternatives Considered |
|-----------|--------|-----|------------------------|
| Language | | | |
| Frontend | | | |
| Backend | | | |
| Database | | | |
| Cache | | | |
| Queue | | | |
| Infrastructure | | | |

## 3. Component Architecture
<!-- Describe each major component, its responsibility, and its interfaces -->

### 3.1 {Component Name}
- **Responsibility:**
- **Interfaces:**
- **Dependencies:**

## 4. Data Models
<!-- Entity-relationship descriptions with field types, constraints, indexes -->

### 4.1 {Entity Name}
| Field | Type | Constraints | Index | Notes |
|-------|------|------------|-------|-------|
| | | | | |

## 5. API Contracts
<!-- RESTful endpoints with methods, paths, request/response payloads -->

### 5.1 {Resource}
```
METHOD /api/v1/{resource}
Request: { }
Response: { }
Status Codes: 200, 400, 401, 404, 500
Auth: Required
```

## 6. Infrastructure Topology
<!-- Compute, storage, networking, scaling strategy -->

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 7.1 Authentication & Authorization
### 7.2 Logging & Monitoring
### 7.3 Error Handling
