sprint_rules:
  - "Each teammate reads their assigned story file(s) COMPLETELY before writing any code"
  - "Backend and frontend must agree on API contracts via inter-agent messaging BEFORE implementing"
  - "All new code must include tests — no story is complete without passing tests"
  - "QA engineer is blocked until implementation stories are complete"
  - "Every teammate messages the team lead when their task is complete"
  - "If any teammate is blocked for > 10 minutes, message the lead immediately"

coordination:
  - between: [backend-dev, frontend-dev]
    topic: "API contracts — agree on endpoints, payloads, and auth before coding"
  - between: [backend-dev, ai-dev]
    topic: "AI pipeline integration points — data flow, WebSocket events, API boundaries"
  - between: [backend-dev, qa-engineer]
    topic: "Share testable endpoints as they're completed"
