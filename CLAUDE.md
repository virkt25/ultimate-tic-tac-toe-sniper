## SNIPER v3 Configuration

This project uses the SNIPER framework for AI-assisted project lifecycle management.

### Quick Start

- `/sniper-flow` — Run the appropriate protocol (auto-detects scope, or use `--protocol <name>`)
- `/sniper-flow --resume` — Resume an interrupted protocol from the last checkpoint
- `/sniper-init` — Re-initialize or update SNIPER configuration
- `/sniper-status` — Show current protocol progress and cost
- `/sniper-review` — Manually trigger a review gate

### Project Structure

```
.sniper/
  config.yaml          — Project configuration
  live-status.yaml     — Real-time protocol progress
  checkpoints/         — Phase checkpoint snapshots
  gates/               — Gate review results
  retros/              — Retrospective reports
  self-reviews/        — Developer self-review artifacts
.claude/
  agents/              — Agent definitions (scaffolded from @sniper.ai/core)
  settings.json        — Claude Code settings with hooks
```

### Configuration

Edit `.sniper/config.yaml` to customize:
- Agent roster and cognitive mixins
- Protocol routing and token budgets
- File ownership boundaries
- Stack-specific commands (test, lint, build)

### Ownership Rules

Agents respect file ownership boundaries. See `.sniper/config.yaml` `ownership` section.
